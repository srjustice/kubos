Communications Service
======================

Communication services serve as the connection between the radio hardware interface and the rest
of the flight software. Communication services are integrated into radio hardware services so that
they provide a tunnel for data to travel through utilizing a specific radio's API while also 
providing a queryable endpoint for GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with. 

An ethernet service provides an example of such integration and services as a mock radio interface.

Comms Service Control Block
---------------------------

The comms service control block is used to pass a specific configuration details into a 
communications service. The control block can be filled manually or with the help of a 
configuration CommsConfig struct that can be used to parse a TOML file to obtain most of the 
configuration details into the control block. Developers will then need to provide connections to
specific interfaces and the read and write functions across those interfaces.

The control block requires filling the following fields:

read
  This is an optional function pointer wrapped in an Arc that will read data from a radio, deframe 
  those data packets, and then compose any fragmented packets into a single UDP packet. This function
  is necessary for developers wanting uplink communication to the radio.

write
  This is a vector of function pointers each wrapped in Arcs that fragment a UDP packet as necessary, 
  frame these fragments and then write these fragments across the radio interface for downlink 
  communication. At least one write function is required for the communication service to work. If
  multiple functions are provided, the first will be used to downlink any responses to uplinked traffic.
  All provided write functions will also be used to spawn endpoints that mission applications can write 
  to downlink information.

read_conn
  This is the interface connection to the radio that the read function will read from.

write_conn
  This is the interface connection to the radio that the write function will write to.


Comms Configuration
-------------------

Developers can use the CommsConfig library to generate easy to utilize structs from TOML files to 
allow developers to quickly reconfigure some details passed into a comms service control block
without needing to recompile the binary of the particular hardware service. 

A complete configuration file will look like the following:

  [ethernet-service]
  handler-port-min = 13002
  handler-port-max = 13010
  downlink-ports = [13011]
  ground-port = 9001
  timeout = 1500
  ground-ip = "192.168.8.1"
  satellite-ip = "192.168.8.2"

Note that all provided fields are optional and will be filled in by default values if they are not 
formatted correctly or not provided.
